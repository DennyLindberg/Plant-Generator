# Features

- C++17
- For Windows (Visual Studio 2017)
- OpenGL 3.3

- Full scene with camera turntable
- Generates trees with continuous branches
- Plenty of leaves
- Only procedural content, no existing textures

# Intentionally missing
- No multi-threading
- No instancing


# Building the code

Get **premake5** for generating makefiles or solutions for your IDE - https://premake.github.io/download.html

After downloading the executable, place it in the root folder. Run `premake5 vs2017` in the terminal or command line to generate a Visual Studio 2017 solution (the solution ends up in the temp folder). Open the solution and you're good to go.
