# Libraries used

**glad** for OpenGL bindings - https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad

**SDL2** for creating a cross-platform OpenGL window with input - https://www.libsdl.org

**glm** for vector and matrix data types compatible with OpenGL - https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html

**lodepng** for loading and saving PNG files - https://lodev.org/lodepng/



# Getting started

Get **premake5** for generating makefiles or solutions for your IDE - https://premake.github.io/download.html

After downloading the executable, place it in the root folder. Run `premake5 vs2017` (Windows) in the terminal or command line to generate a Visual Studio 2017 solution (the solution ends up in the temp folder). Open the solution and you're good to go.



## Folder structure

**binaries/** - contains compiled executable, dlls, images, configs or audio. (screenshots end up here)

**include/** - thirdparty includes.

**libs/** - windows specific libs.

**source/** - main folder for source code.

**temp/** - this folder is generated by premake5 and contains the solution. This folder can be deleted at any time.
